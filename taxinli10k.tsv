The headword is syllabified in W , not in L .  In older dictionaries the words are syllabified mainly to help in pronouncing them; latterly, syllabication has been used largely to find where a word can be hyphenated at the end of a line of text, though, judging by today's newspapers and magazines, one would be sore put to believe that a dictionary had ever been within the grasp of their editors, proofreaders, or the programmers who wrote the hyphenation programs for the automatic typesetting many of them now employ.	You can tell from newspaper and magazines these days that editors are highly adept at hyphenating words.	contradiction	contradiction	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	-	-	-	2311c	verbatim

The answer has nothing to do with their cause, however, but with the simple fact that dictionaries are not exercises in bi-unique substitutability; in other words, if one of the senses of run is `operate' (as in She runs an engine factory ), that does not make it valid to assume that one can substitute operate for run in We run in the marathon every year .  Although recognizing this as a shortcoming of dictionaries and assigning it arbitrarily to what, for lack of a better term, we might call the  genius  of the language, might seem trivial to the casual observer, it is a valid matter for concern in the realm of lexicology.

The headword is syllabified in W , not in L .
